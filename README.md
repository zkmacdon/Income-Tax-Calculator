# Income-Tax-Calculator
An income tax calculator that calculates in both directions. Created using Java and Swing.

## Description
I have always loved working with financial data, and so in my quest to learn Java, I wanted to produce a simple program that 
would allow me to better understand some of the core Java features and the design of the language.


As such, I decided to create something I have used frequently since, a calculator that would take in someone's pre-tax income and return
what would remain after taxes. In order to improve usability, I opted to implement a basic GUI with the Swing library. The result was an easy-to-use program that
allowed me to check how much money I'd be left with after taxes. I also included rudimentary error-handling with error messages displayed on the screen.

## Instructions
In order to try the program, make sure you have the Java JDK installed. Then, once you clone the repository into a directory, open that directory in the command line.
Type javac 'Calculate.java' 'GUI.java', then type java GUI.
